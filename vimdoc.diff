+	- jumping to errors with the |quickfix| commands (|:cc|, |:cn|, |:cp|,
+	  etc.)
+	- jumping to a tag using the |:stag| command.
+	- opening a file using the |CTRL-W_f| or |CTRL-W_F| command.
+	- jumping to a buffer using a buffer split command (e.g.  |:sbuffer|,
+	  |:sbnext|, or |:sbrewind|).

-			This setting is checked with |quickfix| commands, when
-			jumping to errors (":cc", ":cn", "cp", etc.).  It is
-			also used in all buffer related split commands, for
-			example ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", or ":sbrewind".
+	   useopen	If included, jump to the first open window in the
+			current tab page that contains the specified buffer
+			(if there is one).  Otherwise: Do not examine other
