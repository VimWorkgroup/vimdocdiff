-Why should I give money?

 If you do not show your appreciation for Vim, the development team will be
 less motivated to fix bugs and add new features.  They will do something else
 instead.

 That is up to you.  The more you give, the more children will be helped.
 An indication for individuals that use Vim at home: 10 Euro per year.  For
 professional use: 30 Euro per year per person.
 
 
-How do I become a Vim sponsor or registered Vim user?
-
-Send money, as explained above |send-money| and include your e-mail address.
-When the money has been received you will receive a unique registration key.
