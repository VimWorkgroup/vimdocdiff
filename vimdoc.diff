+	The value of this option determines the scroll behavior when opening,
+	closing or resizing horizontal splits. When "on", splitting a window
+	horizontally will keep the same relative cursor position in the old and
+	new window, as well windows that are resized. When "off", scrolling
+	will be avoided to stabilize the window content. Instead, the cursor
+	position will be changed when necessary. In this case, the jumplist
+	will be populated with the previous cursor position. Scrolling cannot
+	be guaranteed to be avoided when 'wrap' is enabled.
