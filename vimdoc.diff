 Problem:  Terminal doesn't handle split UTF-8 sequence after ASCII.
 Solution: Only use one UTF-8 encoding state per vterm state (zeertzjq).
 
+Patch 9.1.2135
+Problem:  search() is used to check for the message from tar that
+          indicates leading slashes found in the tar archive, or to
+          check for the leading slashes themselves. However, if
+          'nowrapscan' is in effect these searches are limited to the
+          last line and don't find any results. This causes the warning
+          message from tar to be seen in the buffer, the "Path Traversal
+          Attack Detected" message to be omitted, and editing actions
+          can fail. This can be seen, for example, when editing
+          src/testdir/samples/evil.tar.
+Solution: Use the 'w' flag for search() (Kevin Goodsell)
