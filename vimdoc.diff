 Not to be used ~
 
 These C99 features are not to be used, because not enough compilers support
 them:
-- Declaration after Statements (MSVC 2012 does not support it).  All
-  declarations need to be at the start of the block.
 - Variable length arrays (even in C11 this is an optional feature).
 - _Bool and _Complex types.
 - "inline" (it's hardly ever needed, let the optimizer do its work)
