+AUTOCOMPLETION						*ins-autocompletion*
+
+Vim can display a completion menu as you type, similar to using |i_CTRL-N|,
+but triggered automatically.  See |'autocomplete'|. The menu items are
+collected from the sources listed in the |'complete'| option.
+
+Unlike manual |i_CTRL-N| completion, this mode uses a decaying timeout to keep
+Vim responsive.  Sources earlier in the |'complete'| list are given more time
+(higher priority), but every source is guaranteed a time slice, however small.
+
+This mode is fully compatible with other completion modes.  You can invoke
+any of them at any time by typing |CTRL-X|, which temporarily suspends
+autocompletion.  To use |i_CTRL-N| specifically, press |CTRL-E| first to
+dismiss the popup menu (see |complete_CTRL-E|).
