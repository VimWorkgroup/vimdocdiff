-The bundling of these files is not automated.  The `src/proto.h` header is

-Due to this design, integrating a new source file within this architecture
-involves creating a corresponding `.pro` file, manually adding a new `#include`
-directive to `proto.h` and manually adding this file to both `src/Makefile` and
-`src/Make_mvc.mak`.

-A `make proto` target exists in `src/Makefile` with the original goal of
-automating the process of updating the `.pro` files.  However, this target is
-unreliable, fails on major platforms (e.g., macOS), and is only part of the
-new release workflow.  In practice, contributors edit the relevant `.pro` files
-by hand when adding, removing, or modifying a function signatures.
+The `make proto` target in `src/Makefile` automates updating most of the .pro
+files using the Python script proto/gen_prototypes.py, which relies on the
+python3-clangd module.  Note that a few proto files are hand edited.
 
 This system has been in place since at least v1.24, when Vim's functions were
 still written in K&R style.
