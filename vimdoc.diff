+5. Policy	*design-policy* *new-features* *deprecated-features*
+
+The time between either a new minor (e.g. 9.2.0) or major (e.g. 10.0) version
+is released is called a development cycle.  Within the development cycle each
+single change to the C core will receive a new increased human-readable patch
+number in order to reference each specific patch release.  A typical
+development release cycle may last several years and accumulate about 1500 -
+2500 patch numbers.
+
+Before a release is made, a stability period will be announced. During this
+time, only clear bug fixes, security fixes, documentation changes, translation
+updates and runtime file updates will be accepted (provided they do not
+introduce backwards-incompatible changes), concentrating on polishing up the
+upcoming release.
+
+New features are accepted only within a development cycle, but not within the
+stability period.  During the cycle, new features may be developed and are
+allowed to change, but they must be settled before the cycle closes.
+
+Once a minor release has been made, features included in that release must not
+receive any backwards-incompatible changes.  Later patches are expected to
+preserve compatibility for the C core of Vim.  Runtime files are handled a bit
+more flexibly to give runtime files maintainers a chance to change old
+behaviour.
+
+Within a development cycle, features may be marked as deprecated. Deprecated
+features can be disabled at compile time through an appropriate switch. After
+a new release, deprecated features may be removed completely in a following
+cycle.
