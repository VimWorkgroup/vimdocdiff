 In order to obtain the best formatted output g/troff can give you, you should
 follow a few simple rules about spacing and punctuation.
 
-1. Do not leave empty spaces at the end of lines.

-2. Leave one space and one space only after an end-of-sentence period,

+4. Use the empty request, a '.' on a line by itself, freely to visually

-Unlike TeX, troff fills text line-by-line, not paragraph-by-paragraph and,
-furthermore, it does not have a concept of glue or stretch, all horizontal and

+sentences, and can use that information to apply inter-sentence space.  Using

-Therefore, you should be careful about not using more space between sentences
