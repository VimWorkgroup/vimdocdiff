+XDG Base Directory Specification ~
+
+The XDG Base Directory Specification aims to define a standard location for
+configuration files used by applications.  This is mainly done to prevent
+the legacy behavior of dumping everything into the users home directory.
+The specification can be found online at
+https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/
+
+The location of this standard configuration directory is configurable by the
+user, using environment variable but should also give fallback in case those
+variables weren't set.
+
+This is a not an exhaustive list of those directories:
+   Environment var	default location	Description ~
+  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`	$HOME/.cache		Ephemiral data files
+  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`	$HOME/.config		Configuration files
+  `$XDG_DATA_HOME`	$HOME/.local/share	Persistent data files
+  `$XDG_STATE_HOME`	$HOME/.local/state	State data files
+
+Vim will only care of the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory, the others are not
+(yet) used for its various configuration and state files.
+
+							*xdg-vimrc*
+Vim, on Unix systems, will look at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/vimrc` for its
+configuration (see |vimrc|) but it will source it only if no other
+initialization file is found in `$HOME` or `$HOME/.vim` (thus making this
+feature backward compatible). However, if you want to migrate to use
+`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/` directory, you will have to move away your `~/.vimrc`
+and `~/.vim/vimrc` file.
+
+							*xdg-runtime*
+When the |xdg-vimrc| is used the |'runtimepath'| will be modified accordingly
+to respect the |xdg-base-dir|: >

+    "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim,$VIMRUNTIME,/after,$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/after"
