 2. Compiling Vim with Perl interface			*perl-compiling*
 
-To compile Vim with Perl interface, you need Perl 5.004 (or later).  Perl must
-be installed before you compile Vim.  Vim's Perl interface does NOT work with
-the 5.003 version that has been officially released!  It will probably work
-with Perl 5.003_05 and later.
+To compile Vim with the Perl interface, you need a recent Perl version.  Perl
+must be installed before you compile Vim.
