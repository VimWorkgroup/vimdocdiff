+          which may result in "E479: No match" (hebaronson)
+Solution: temporarily reset 'wildignore' setting when building the :drop
+          command
+
+Patch 9.1.0046
+Problem:  :drop does not re-use empty buffer (Rocco Mao)
+Solution: Make :drop re-use an empty buffer (Rocco Mao)
+
+Patch 9.1.0047
+Problem:  Things that temporarily change/restore curwin/buf (e.g: win_execute,
+          some autocmds) may break assumptions that curwin/buf is the cmdwin
+          when "cmdwin_type != 0", causing issues.
+Solution: Expose the cmdwin's real win/buf and check that instead. Also try to
+          ensure these variables are NULL if "cmdwin_type == 0", allowing them
+          to be used directly in most cases without checking cmdwin_type.
+          (Sean Dewar).
+
+Patch 9.1.0048
+Problem:  Autocmds triggered from opening the cmdwin (in win_split and
+          do_ecmd) can cause issues such as E199, as the current checks
+          are insufficient.
+Solution: Commands executed from the cmdwin apply to the old curwin/buf, so
+          they should be kept in a "suspended" state; abort if they've
+          changed. Also abort if cmdwin/buf was tampered with, and check that
+          curwin is correct. Try to clean up the cmdwin buffer (only if hidden
+          and non-current to simplify things; the same approach is used when
+          closing cmdwin normally), and add a beep. (Sean Dewar)
+
+Patch 9.1.0049
+Problem:  E95 is possible if a buffer called "[Command Line]" already exists
+          when opening the cmdwin. This can also happen if the cmdwin's buffer
+          could not be deleted when closing.
+Solution: Un-name the cmdwin buffer, and give it a special name instead,
+          similar to what's done for quickfix buffers and for unnamed prompt
+          and scratch buffers. As a result, BufFilePre/Post are no longer
+          fired when opening the cmdwin. Add a "command" key to the dictionary
+          returned by getbufinfo() to differentiate the cmdwin buffer instead.
+          (Sean Dewar)
+
+Patch 9.1.0050
+Problem:  Win32 Keyboard handling is sub-optimal and has many issues with
+          international keyboards (risa2000) (after v8.2.4807)
+Solution: soft-rollback the change, allow the user to select a suitable
+          key-translation strategy (Anton Sharonov)

+          spaces (VanaIgr)
+
+Patch 9.1.0057
+Problem:  MS-Windows: Key event test still fails
+Solution: Skip testing CTRL-C, since it causes an Interrupt which causes a
+          test failure (after 9.1.0053)
+
+Patch 9.1.0058

+          Seibert)
+
+Patch 9.1.0070

+
+Patch 9.1.0073
+Problem:  Looping over modifier_keys_table[] unnecessarily with only
+          MOD_MASK_ALT or MOD_MASK_CMD, as modifier_keys_table[] only contains
+          MOD_MASK_SHIFT and MOD_MASK_CTRL, and the loop won't do anything.
+Solution: Remove MOD_MASK_ALT and MOD_MASK_CMD from the condition (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.0074
+Problem:  did_set_breakat() should be in optionstr.c as 'breakat' is a string

+
+Patch 9.1.0077
+Problem:  The call to redraw_for_cursorline() in nv_mousescroll() is
+          unnecessary because redraw_for_cursorline() only sets redraw type to
+          UPD_VALID, and all code paths in do_mousescroll() already set redraw
+          type to at least UPD_VALID.
+Solution: Remove call to redraw_for_cursorline() in nv_mousescroll()
+          (zeertzjq).
+

+          (lilydjwg)
+
+Patch 9.1.0082
+Problem:  Redrawing can be improved when deleting lines with 'cursorline'.
+Solution: Use smarter invalidation and adjustment.  Remove unnecessary
+          UPD_VALID as it is already set at the top of the loop.  Make the
+          test for #4862 fail without the fix (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.0083
+Problem:  Redrawing can be improved when inserting/deleting lines with
+          'number'.

+
+Patch 9.1.0084
+Problem:  Visual hl wrong when it ends before multibyte 'showbreak' (lacygoil)
+Solution: Use vcol_sbr instead of adding n_extra (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.0085

+
+Patch 9.1.0086
+Problem:  Problem when scrolling using slow touchpads scroll event
+Solution: Better ways to determine if a smooth scroll has ended (when

+          will change later in the function.
+Solution: Restore lastused_tabpage a bit later, when being done with
+          tabpages (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.0088
+Problem:  TextChanged not triggered for :norm! commands (machakann, after
+          v9.0.2031)
+Solution: Only reset curbuf->b_last_changedtick if TextChangedI was triggered
+          in insert mode (and not blocked)

+
+Patch 9.1.0100
+Problem:  When undoing with 'spell', redrawWinline() is called after

+
+Patch 9.1.0118
+Problem:  saving and restoring all frames to split-move is overkill now

+Patch 9.1.0124
+Problem:  Virtual text with text_align 'right'/'below' wasn't being used when
+          a non-virtual text property overlaps with the end of the line. This
+          was because the non-virtual text property had a higher priority,
+          preventing the virtual text from being used.
+Solution: Fix the sorting of text properties so virtual text properties have a
+          higher priority than non-virtual text properties (Dylan
+          Thacker-Smith).
+

+Problem:  Virtual text with text_wrap 'wrap' was effectively being truncated
+          by a break conditional on the EOL list character being added to the
+          screen line. (BigPeet)
+Solution: Remove the condition that was leading to the early break and instead
+          fix a similar but incorrectly written outer condition that checks if
+          there is more to add at the end of the screen line. (Dylan

+Patch 9.1.0132
+Problem:  using "C" and 've=all' set, doesn't include composing chars when
+          changing a line, keeps the composing chars for whatever is typed

+          (zeertzjq)
+
+Patch 9.1.0133
+Problem:  font ligatures don't render correctly in the Win32 GUI-version of
+          gvim even when set rop=type:directx is used. Setting guiligatures
+          also doesn't make any difference. This leads to broken font
+          ligatures when the cursor passes through them. It does not recover
+          from this, and they remain broken until you re-render the whole
+          buffer (e.g. by using Ctrl+L).
+Solution: The problem is that we only re-draw the current and previous
+          character in gui_undraw_cursor() and only have the special case for
+          GTK when it comes to rendering ligatures. So let's enable
+          gui_adjust_undraw_cursor_for_ligatures() to also happen for Win32
+          GUI if guiligatures is setup correctly (all this does is expand the
+          range of gui_undraw_cursor() with ligature characters).

+Problem:  too many STRLEN calls when getting a memline

+
+Patch 9.1.0139

+Patch 9.1.0140
+Problem:  The cursor screen row was incorrectly being calculated when the
+          cursor follows a 1 character text_align 'below' virtual text line,
+          resulting in the cursor being shown on the wrong line. This was
+          caused by a cell size of 2 instead of 1 being used for the EOL
+          character, which propagated to the calculation of space for putting
+          the 'below' virtual text on its own line. (rickhowe)
+Solution: Fix the size used for the EOL character in calculating the cursor's
+          screen position (Dylan Thacker-Smith).

+Patch 9.1.0143
+Problem:  [security]: autocmd cause use-after-free in set_curbuf()

+          is decremented otherwise it cannot be wiped

+Problem:  qf_goto_win_with_qfl_file may check if prevwin has 'winfixbuf'
+          set without checking if it's valid first.
+Solution: Reverse the condition. Add a test, a modeline, and a missing

+
+Patch 9.1.0150
+Problem:  several minor 'winfixbuf' issues exist, mostly relating to the

+Problem:  may not be clear why failing to split causes an ":Xdo" command to
+          abort if 'wfb' is set.
+Solution: Do not return immediately if win_split fails, so E1513 is still

+Problem:  current window number returned by tabpagewinnr may be outdated when
+          called from win_execute for the original tabpage.
+Solution: update the original tabpage's tp_curwin in switch_win; use

+
+Patch 9.1.0173
+Problem:  msgfmt ver. 0.22 forcibly converts text to UTF-8

+Problem:  winframe functions incorrectly recompute window positions if
+          the altframe wasn't adjacent to the closed frame, which is
+          possible if adjacent windows had 'winfix{width,height}' set.
+Solution: recompute for windows within the parent of the altframe and
+          closed frame. Skip this (as before) if the altframe was
+          top/left, but only if adjacent to the closed frame, as

+Patch 9.1.0198
+Problem:  Vim9: compound operators broken for lambdas in an object
+          (girishji)

+          instruction to load the object (Yegappan Lakshmanan).
+
+Patch 9.1.0199
+Problem:  Not enough tests for the slice() function.
+Solution: Test with multibyte chars, and in both Legacy and Vim9 script.
+          Update docs to be clearer about how it treats composing chars
+          (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.0200
+Problem:  `gj`/`gk` was updating the desired cursor virtual column to
+          the outer virtual text, even though the actual cursor position
+          was moved to not be on the virtual text, leading the need to
+          do an extra `gj`/`gk` to move past each virtual text line (rickhowe).
+Solution: Exclude the outer virtual text when getting the line length
+          for moving the cursor with `gj`/`gk`, so that no extra movement is
+          needed to skip over virtual text lines (Dylan Thacker-Smith).
+
+Patch 9.1.0201
+Problem:  `gM` would include outer virtual text and its padding when
+          getting the line length used to calculate the middle of the
+          line, putting the cursor much closer to virtual text lines.
+Solution: Exclude outer virtual text in getting the line length for
+          `gM`, so that virtual text doesn't influence where the cursor
+          is moved to (Dylan Thacker-Smith).

+
+Patch 9.1.0205
+Problem:  Cannot use modifiers before :-Ntabmove.
+Solution: Check backwards from the command instead of checking from the start
+          of the command line. Slightly adjust docs to make them more
+          consistent (zeertzjq).
+

+          (Tim Pope, after v9.1.0147)

+          since it just re-loads the current buffer (Colin Kennedy).

+          buttons pointer.
+
+Patch 9.1.0211
+Problem:  Page-wise scrolling with Ctrl-F/Ctrl-B implements it's own logic to
+          change the topline and cursor. In doing so, skipcol is not handled
+          properly for 'smoothscroll', and virtual lines.
+Solution: Re-use the logic from Ctrl-E/Ctrl-Y while staying backward
+          compatible as much as possible.
+
+Patch 9.1.0212
+Problem:  CI: MS-Windows fails in test_winfixbuf (after v9.1.208)

+Problem:  CI: MS-Windows fails in test_winfixbuf (after v9.1.208)
+Solution: Instead of skipping the test, write the file so it exists on disk,

+          (Sean Dewar)
+
+Patch 9.1.0214
+Problem:  Duplicate condition in win_lbr_chartabsize().
+Solution: Remove the duplicate condition, as it's already checked above.
+          (zeertzjq)
+
+Patch 9.1.0215
+Problem:  Page-wise scrolling with Ctrl-D/Ctrl-U implements
+          it's own logic to change the topline and cursor.
+          More logic than necessary for scrolling with Ctrl-F/Ctrl-B
+          was removed in Patch 9.1.0211.
+Solution: Re-use the logic from Ctrl-E/Ctrl-Y/Ctrl-F/Ctrl-B while
+          staying backward compatible as much as possible.
+          Restore some of the logic that determined how many lines will
+          be scrolled (Luuk van Baal)

+Problem:  regexp: verymagic cannot match before/after a mark
+Solution: Correctly check for the very magic check (Julio B)
+
+Patch 9.1.0218
+Problem:  Unnecessary multiplications in backspace code, as "col / ts * ts" is
+          the same as "col - col % ts".
+Solution: Change "col / ts * ts" to "col - col % ts".  Adjust the loop
+          and the comments ins_bs() to be easier to understand.  Update
+          tests to reset 'smarttab' properly (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.0219
+Problem:  No enum support
+Solution: Implement enums for Vim9 script (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
+
+Patch 9.1.0220
+Problem:  Typos in code and tests.
+Solution: Fix typos (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.0221
+Problem:  The if branch to set `text_prop_follows` was both checking if
+          it was at the end of the buffer text line or if it was at the
+          end of the screen line, but the former being true skipped
+          a guard condition in the latter to only consider 'below'
+          virtual text to follow. `text_prop_follows` being improperly
+          set caused it to skip a conditional block to break at the end
+          as well as one to move `ptr` to the end of the text line,
+          while repeated for each following line of the window.
+Solution: Move the check for whether 'below' virtual text should follow
+          so it is also used when at the end of the buffer text line.
+          (Dylan Thacker-Smith)
+
+Patch 9.1.0222
+Problem:  When a line is truncated just before 'after'/'right' virtual
+          text and the line also has 'below' virtual text, then the
+          'below' virtual text would not be displayed, depending on the
+          order these text properties were added.
+Solution: In the loop to make text properties active, skip instead of
+          break for 'after'/'right' virtual text properties that are
+          ignored due to truncation, so following 'below' text properties can
+          still be made active. Similarly, a loop is needed to determine if a
+          text property follows at the end of the screen. (Dylan
+          Thacker-Smith)
+
+Patch 9.1.0223
+Problem:  There are two dense conditions with duplication that needs to
+          be kept in sync between the while loop break condition and the
+          condition to skip certain text properties.
+Solution: Refactor the loop by moving while loop conditions into the body of
+          the while loop so they can be shared with skip conditions. `break`
+          and an `active` variable are used to handle the outcome of these
+          merged conditions (Dylan Thacker-Smith).
+
+Patch 9.1.0224
+Problem:  If a line has "right" & "below" virtual text properties, where the
+          "below" property may be stored first due to lack of ordering between
+          them, then the line height is calculated to be 1 more and causes the
+          cursor to far over the line.
+Solution: Remove some unnecessary setting of a `next_right_goes_below = TRUE`
+          flag for "below" and "above" text properties. (Dylan Thacker-Smith)
+
+Patch 9.1.0225
+Problem:  test_matchparen not run in CI

+Solution: Clear typval pointer, before setting the type
+          (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
+
+Patch 9.1.0993
+Problem:  Although Patch 9.1.0990 fixed a real problem/inconsistency,
+          it also introduced new behavior that may break BWC and/or be
+          unexpected. Before 9.1.0990, window commands could make the
+          topframe smaller (without changing 'cmdheight'; quirk that is
+          now fixed), but did not allow extending the topframe beyond
+          the 'cmdheight' set by the user. After 9.1.0990, the user can
+          reduce the 'cmdheight' below the value they set explicitly,
+          through window commands, which may lead to confusion.
+          (aftere v9.1.0990)
+Solution: Store the value explicitly set by the user and clamp the
+          'cmdheight' when resizing the topframe. This also applies to
+          dragging laststatus, which in contrast to window commands
+          _did_ allow reducing the 'cmdheight' to values below the one
+          set by the user. So with this Patch there is still new
+          behavior, but I think in a way that is less surprising.
+          While at it, also fix a Coverity warning, introduced in
+          v9.1.0990 (Luuk van Baal).
+

+
+Patch 9.1.1077
+Problem:  Syntax engine interpreted contains=TOP as matching nothing
+          inside included files, since :syn-include forces HL_CONTAINED
+          on for every included item. After 8.2.2761, interprets
+          contains=TOP as contains=@INCLUDED, which is also not correct
+          since it doesn't respect exclusions, and doesn't work if there
+          is no @INCLUDED cluster.
+Solution: Revert Patch 8.2.2761, instead track groups that have had
+          HL_CONTAINED forced, and interpret contains=TOP and
+          contains=CONTAINED using this (Theodore Dubois).

+          (Yee Cheng Chin).

+Problem:  Enabling termguicolors automatically confuses users. Since
+          querying the terminal for the RGB flag happens asynchronously,
+          enabling termguicolors is noticeable by users as the highlighting
+          changes and is therefore unexpected (after v9.1.1054).
+Solution: Comment out that part for now. We may need another way to enable
+          this in the future.
+
+Patch 9.1.1115

+          visible (lifepillar)
+Solution: When Enter is pressed and no complete-item is selected,

+
+Patch 9.1.1123
+Problem:  Highlight groups PopupSelected/PopupNotification/
+          MessageWindow are supposed to fall back to default highlight
+          groups if they are not defined. However, once a colorscheme
+          has defined them, switching to another colorscheme that
+          doesn't do so will leave behind a cleared colorscheme, which
+          causes the fallback to fail.
+Solution: Set up default links to the relevant fallback highlight
+          groups, which makes sure a `:hi clear` command will reset the
+          state properly (Yee Cheng Chin).
+
+Patch 9.1.1124
+Problem:  No test for 'listchars' "precedes" with double-width char.
+Solution: Add a test and fix a typo in code (zeertzjq).

+Solution: Detect xkb files in more places (David Mandelberg).
+

+          only completed the highlight group names.
+Solution: Implement full completion for the highlight group arguments
+          such as guifg and cterm. If the user tries to complete
+          immediately after the '=' (e.g. `hi Normal guifg=<Tab>`), the
+          completion will fill in the existing value, similar to how
+          cmdline completion for options work (Yee Cheng Chin).
+
+Patch 9.1.1139

+Solution: Make sure cursor column doesn't become negative.
+
+Patch 9.1.1144

+
+Patch 9.1.1150
+Problem:  :highlight auto-complettion has a minor bug where an existing
+          highlight group with a cterm color being unset would result in
+          it being auto-completed to -1 in cmdline which is invalid.
+Solution: Correctly check for whether an int value is set to non-zero
+          before retrieving the existing value for auto-complete. Also
+          do this for attr/string values as they previously worked only
+          by accident (Yee Cheng Chin).
+
+Patch 9.1.1151
+Problem:  too many strlen() calls in getchar.c
+Solution: Store last inserted and recorded lengths, add functions to retrieve

+
+Patch 9.1.1160
+Problem:  The 'preinsert' feature requires Ctrl-Y to confirm insertion,
+          but Ctrl-Y only works when the popup menu (pum) is displayed.
+Solution: Modify ins_compl_has_preinsert() to check for both 'menu' and
+          'menuone' flags when 'preinsert' is set. Update documentation
+          to clarify this requirement. This avoids adding complex
+          conditional behaviors (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1161
+Problem:  preinsert requires bot "menu" and "menuone" to be set,
+          but "menu" is redundant (after v9.1.1160)

+          prematurely clearing the clear_cmdline flag (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1163
+Problem:  $MYVIMDIR is set too late and not available while sourcing
+          runtime files (Maxim Kim, after v9.1.1159).

+
+Patch 9.1.1174

+Problem:  The meaning of <Tab> depends on unspecified behavior
+          (after 9.1.1179).

+          (Hirohito Higashi)
+
+Patch 9.1.1193
+Problem:  Unnecessary use of STRCAT() in au_event_disable().  STRCAT()
+          seeks to the end of new_ei, but here the end is already known.
+Solution: Use STRCPY() and add p_ei_len to new_ei.  Also fix a typo in a

+          crafted zip files (RyotaK)
+Solution: Use glob '[-]' to protect filenames starting with '-'.

+Patch 9.1.1199
+Problem:  Many X11/Wayland desktops support icon themes, and many themes
+          provide a gvim icon, but this icon is ignored for the window

+          higher than exact prefix matches like Cursor, which is
+          counter-intuitive (Maxim Kim).
+Solution: Add a 'camelcase' option to matchfuzzy() that lets users disable

+Solution: Add some tests (Maxim Kim).
+
+Patch 9.1.1228

+Problem:  Compile error with C89 compiler in term.c (Zoltan Arpadffy)
+Solution: split out LOG_TR macro into 2 different macros. LOG_TR1 that
+          takes only a single argument and LOG_TRN that takes 2
+          arguments. Remove the use of ##__VA_ARGS__ since the macro is
+          now always called with 2 arguments (Hirohito Higashi).

+          correctly when splitting a window on a line longer than the
+          last line on the screen (after v9.1.0707)

+          get_lval() (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.1243
+Problem:  Diff mode's inline highlighting is lackluster. It only
+          performs a line-by-line comparison, and calculates a single
+          shortest range within a line that could encompass all the
+          changes. In lines with multiple changes, or those that span
+          multiple lines, this approach tends to end up highlighting
+          much more than necessary.
+Solution: Implement new inline highlighting modes by doing per-character
+          or per-word diff within the diff block, and highlight only the
+          relevant parts, add "inline:simple" to the defaults (which is
+          the old behaviour) (Yee Cheng Chin)

+          (after v9.1.1243)
+Solution: Fix typos and slightly improve the docs (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.1253
+Problem:  If win_close() is called with a window that has quickfix stack
+          attached to it, the corresponding quickfix buffer will be
+          closed and freed after the buffer was already closed. At that
+          time curwin->w_buffer points to NULL, which the CHECK_CURBUF
+          will catch and abort if ABORT_ON_ERROR is defined.
+Solution: In wipe_qf_buffer() temporarily point curwin->w_buffer back to
+          curbuf, the window will be closed anyhow, so it shouldn't
+          matter that curbuf->b_nwindows isn't incremented.

+Solution: If the :stopinsert command is received while waiting for
+          input, stuff the NOP key into the type-ahead buffer and

+Problem:  When switching to another window or tab page while the
+          completion menu is active, the menu stays visible, although it
+          belongs to the previous window/tab page context (Evgeni
+          Chasnovski).
+Solution: Track the window and tab page where completion started. Detect
+          changes in the main editing loop and cancel completion mode if
+          the current window or tab page differs from where completion
+          started.
+
+Patch 9.1.1306
+Problem:  Parts of the popup menu were rendered twice when the popup was
+          at maximum width because the truncation flag was being set too

+Solution: Make the truncation condition more precise by only setting it
+          when there's exactly one character of space remaining (glepnir).

+
+Patch 9.1.1308
+Problem:  During insert-mode completion, the most relevant match is often
+          the one closest to the cursor—frequently just above the current line.
+          However, both `<C-N>` and `<C-P>` tend to rank candidates from the
+          current buffer that appear above the cursor near the bottom of the
+          completion menu, rather than near the top. This ordering can feel
+          unintuitive, especially when `noselect` is active, as it doesn't
+          prioritize the most contextually relevant suggestions.
+Solution: This change introduces a new sub-option value "nearest" for the
+          'completeopt' setting. When enabled, matches from the current buffer
+          are prioritized based on their proximity to the cursor position,
+          improving the relevance of suggestions during completion
+        (Girish Palya).
+
+Patch 9.1.1309
+Problem:  tests: no test for 'pummaxwidth' with non-truncated "kind".
+Solution: Add a test with "kind" and larger 'pummaxwidth' (zeertzjq).

+
+Patch 9.1.1355
+Problem:  The pum_redraw function is too complex and difficult to
+          maintain with nested loops and mixed responsibilities handling
+          both RTL and LTR text rendering.
+Solution: Extracted core rendering logic into dedicated helper functions
+          (pum_display_rtl_text, pum_display_ltr_text, pum_draw_scrollbar,
+          pum_process_item) while preserving the original behavior. This
+          improves code readability and maintainability (glepnir).

+Problem:  [security]: Possible to open more windows into a closing
+          buffer without splitting, bypassing existing "b_locked_split"
+          checks and triggering use-after-free
+Solution: Disallow switching to a closing buffer. Editing a closing
+          buffer (via ":edit", etc.) was fixed in v9.1.0764, but add an
+          error message and check just "b_locked_split", as "b_locked"
+          is necessary only when the buffer shouldn't be wiped, and may
+          be set for buffers that are in-use but not actually closing
+          (Sean Dewar).

+Solution: Consolidate into a single equality check using bitwise OR and
+          comparison (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1374
+Problem:  Currently, 'smartcase' is respected when completing keywords
+          using <C-N>, <C-P>, <C-X><C-N>, and <C-X><C-P>. However, when
+          a user continues typing and the completion menu is filtered
+          using cached matches, 'smartcase' is not applied. This leads
+          to poor-quality or irrelevant completion suggestions, as shown
+          in the example below.
+Solution: When filtering cached completion items after typing additional
+          characters, apply case-sensitive comparison if 'smartcase' is
+          enabled and the typed pattern includes uppercase characters.
+          This ensures consistent and expected completion behavior
+          (Girish Palya).
+
+Patch 9.1.1375
+Problem:  heap use-after-free possible when autocommands switch away from the
+          quickfix dummy buffer, but leave it open in a window.
+Solution: Close its windows first before attempting the wipe (Sean Dewar).
+
+Patch 9.1.1376
+Problem:  when failing to wipeout a quickfix dummy buffer, it will
+          remain as a dummy buffer, despite being kept.
+Solution: Clear its dummy BF_DUMMY flag in this case (Sean Dewar).
+
+Patch 9.1.1377
+Problem:  Some GTK3 users experienced unexpectedly small windows at
+          startup (after v9.1.1368, @berggeist, Tony Mechelynck)
+Solution: Update window manager hints in gui_mch_open, partly revert
+          v9.1.1370 (Drew Vogel).
+
+Patch 9.1.1378
+Problem:  When 'signcolumn' is set to `number` but a line has a sign
+          without text, the line number disappears (finite-state-machine)
+Solution: Verify that a sign actually contains text before rendering the
+          line number (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1379
+Problem:  MS-Windows: error when running evim when space in path of Vim
+Solution: Properly parse quoted strings (Miguel Barro)
+
+Patch 9.1.1380
+Problem:  When an autocommand executes for a non-current buffer,
+          'eventignorewin' is only checked from the buffer's last
+          wininfo (overwrites win_ignore in the loop), not from the
+          value of 'eventignorewin' in all windows showing the buffer as
+          described (after v9.1.1084)
+Solution: Fix the check and don't use wininfo, as that may only contain
+          windows that recently showed the buffer. Consider all the
+          buffer's windows in all tabpages (Sean Dewar).
+
+Patch 9.1.1381
+Problem:  Cannot return to the original text after selecting the next
+          item when the currently selected item is the last one.

+          linked list (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1382
+Problem:  if_ruby: unused compiler warnings from ruby internals
+Solution: disable -Wunused-parameter for if_ruby internal code (Philip H.).
+
+Patch 9.1.1383
+Problem:  When a space character is used as a trigger in 'isexpand' option
+          it doesn't get recognized because skip_to_option_part() skips
+          spaces after a comma, treating them as option separators
+          rather than option value (after v9.1.1341)
+Solution: Manually set the part to a space character (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1384
+Problem:  still some problem with the new tutors filetype plugin
+Solution: Refactor code to enable/disable tutor mode into

+
+Patch 9.1.1385
+Problem:  Loop that ensures "w_skipcol" is zero with 'nosmoothscroll'
+          for (half)-page scrolling is inefficient.
+Solution: Calculate the required "count" instead of looping until
+          "w_skipcol" is zero (Luuk van Baal).
+
+Patch 9.1.1386
+Problem:  MS-Windows: some minor problems building on AARCH64
+Solution: Update Make_cyg_ming with aarch64 specific changes,
+          document how to build on aarch64 using msys2 packages.
+
+Patch 9.1.1387
+Problem:  buflist_new() leaks ffname and fails to reuse curbuf when
+          autocommands from buf_freeall change curbuf. Plus, a new
+          buffer is not allocated in this case, despite what the comment
+          above claims.
+Solution: Remove the condition so ffname is not leaked and so a new
+          buffer is allocated like before v8.2.4791. It should not be
+          possible for undo_ftplugin or buf_freeall autocommands to
+          delete the buffer as they set b_locked, but to stay consistent
+          with other uses of buf_freeall, guard against that anyway
+          (Sean Dewar).
+
+Patch 9.1.1388
+Problem:  One-off error in "count" to make "w_skipcol" zero with
+          'nosmoothscroll' page scrolling when last virtual line
+          in a buffer line is exactly the entire window width
+          (Hirohito Higashi).
+Solution: Properly compute the smallest integer value necessary
+          to make "w_skipcol" zero (Luuk van Baal).
+
+Patch 9.1.1389
+Problem:  Cannot get completion startcol when space is not the first
+          trigger character (after v9.1.1383)
+Solution: Detect the next comma followed by a space in the option string
+          and use in next compare loop (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1390
+Problem:  style: more wrong indentation
+Solution: reformat a few more places (Yegappan Lakshmanan).
+
+Patch 9.1.1391
+Problem:  Vim does not have a tabpanel
+Solution: Include the tabpanel feature (Naruhiko Nishino, thinca).
+
+Patch 9.1.1392
+Problem:  missing Patch number (Tony Mechelynck)
+Solution: add missing Patche number.
+
+Patch 9.1.1393
+Problem:  The check in buf_freeall that restores curwin subtly prevents
+          leaving an unloaded buffer in a window when reusing curbuf, if
+          autocommands switch to a different buffer.
+Solution: Add a test case that covers this. Also ensure splitting isn't
+          possible, as that could do the same (Sean Dewar).
+
+Patch 9.1.1394
+Problem:  tabpanel not correctly redrawn on tabonly
+          (Maxim Kim, after v9.1.1391)

+
+Patch 9.1.1395
+Problem:  Search_stat not reset when pattern differs in case
+          (tahzibijafar)
+Solution: Use STRNCMP instead of MB_STRNICMP macro.
+
+Patch 9.1.1396
+Problem:  The 'grepformat' option is global option, but it would be
+          useful to have it buffer-local, similar to 'errorformat' and
+          other quickfix related options (Dani Dickstein)
+Solution: Add the necessary code to support global-local 'grepformat',
+          allowing different buffers to parse different grep output
+          formats (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1397
+Problem:  tabpanel not correctly updated on :tabonly (Maxim Kim)
+Solution: Force a redraw, take 'equalalways' into account (Naruhiko Nishino).
+
+Patch 9.1.1398
+Problem:  When items are combined with user-defined highlight attributes
+          (e.g., strikethrough), trunc inherits these attributes, making
+          the text difficult to read.
+Solution: Trunc now uses the original Pmenu and PmenuSel highlight
+          attributes (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1399
+Problem:  tests: test_codestyle fails for auto-generated files.
+          While those files are already ignored in Test_source_Files(),
+          the newly added Test_indent_of_source_files() does not filter
+          those out and causes test failures on appveyor.
+Solution: Factor out the generation of all c files into a common function
+          and filter out auto-generated files if_ole.h, iid_ole.c and
+          dlldata.c
+

+
+Patch 9.1.1403
+Problem:  expansion of 'tabpanelopt' value adds wrong values
+          (Shane-XB-Qian, after v9.1.1391).

+
+Patch 9.1.1404

+
+Patch 9.1.1512
+Problem:  completion: can only complete from keyword characters
+Solution: Remove this restriction, allow completion functions when

+Problem:  Test_termdebug_decimal_breakpoints() fails with List index out
+          of range, because when adding the second breakpoint, the
+          cursor is still on the very first line
+Solution: Run the program, so that it will break at the very first
+          defined breakpoint and then once we are in the program,

+Patch 9.1.1520
+Problem:  When using `/` or `?` in command-line mode with 'ignorecase' and
+          'smartcase' enabled, the completion menu could show items that
+          don't actually match any text in the buffer due to case mismatches
+Solution: Instead of validating menu items only against the user-typed
+          pattern, the new logic also checks whether the completed item
+          matches actual buffer content. If needed, it retries the match
+          using a lowercased version of the candidate, respecting
+          smartcase semantics.
+
+Patch 9.1.1521
+Problem:  When 'wildmode' is set to include "noselect", the popup menu (pum)
+          incorrectly retained its scroll position when reopened. This
+          meant that after scrolling down through the menu with `<C-n>`,
+          reopening the menu (e.g., by retyping the command and
+          triggering completion again) would show the menu starting from
+          the previously scrolled position, rather than from the top.
+Solution: Ensure that the popup menu resets its scroll position to the
+          top when reopened (Girish Palya).
+
+Patch 9.1.1522
+Problem:  tests: still some ANSI escape sequences in test messages output

+
+Patch 9.1.1536
+Problem:  tests: test_plugin_comment.vim uses :CheckScreenDump check but
+          doesn't actually use a screen dump.
+Solution: Use :CheckRunVimInTerminal instead, remove a few empty lines.
+
+Patch 9.1.1537
+Problem:  helptoc: some issues when parsing markdown code blocks (VimWei)
+Solution: Assign nextline to curline before starting the next loop
+          iteration; when processing fenced code blocks, flip the
+          skip_fence variable, update the test to be more comprehensive.
+
+Patch 9.1.1539

+Problem:  Vim crashes during omnifunc completion inside the command-line
+          window ("q:") if the completion item attempts to open an "info"

+
+Patch 9.1.1563
+Problem:  The ruler disappears after typing the second character during
+          insert mode completion, even when completion messages are
+          suppressed ('shortmess' includes "c"). This makes the UI
+          appear inconsistent.

+          completion is active (Girish Palya).
+
+Patch 9.1.1564

+          existing buffer (Sean Dewar).

+          the command line's content hadn't actually changed.
+Solution: Add a check to compare the command-line buffer's state

+Solution: Check if the icon theme as used in Patch 1199 contains a gvim
+          icon. If so, set the window's icon from that. Otherwise
+          use the previous method (Olaf Seibert)

+Problem:  When the popup menu (PUM) occupies more than half the screen
+          height, it flickers whenever a character is typed or erased.
+Solution: A complete, non-hacky fix would require removing the
+          CmdlineChanged event from the loop and letting autocompletion

+          after any cmdline change are necessary for other features to
+          work (Girish Palya).

+Solution: Set the $NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath before running
+          external commands.
+
+Patch 9.1.1948
+Problem:  Windows: Vim always adds the current directory to search path.
+          This should only happen when using cmd.exe as 'shell'. For
+          example, powershell won't run binaries from the current
+          directory.
+Solution: Only add current directory to system path, when using cmd.exe
+          as 'shell'.
+
+Patch 9.1.1949
+Problem:  :stag does not use 'swichtbuf' option, though the

+Problem:  Outputting long strings using :echowindow wraps one character
+          per line and display in reverse order (Hirohito Higashi)
+Solution: Use full width for :echowindow, reset msg_col after wrapping,
+          and increment lnum correctly when creating new lines (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1960
+Problem:  When the popup menu is displayed above the cursor and the
+          selected item has no room below for the info popup,
+          popup_adjust_position() places the popup in the available
+          space above. The calculation added some extra lines, causing
+          the popup to be misaligned.
+Solution: For info popups, undo that extra spacing so the popup stays
+          aligned with the selected item (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.1961
+Problem:  :0tab behaves like :tab for :stag when 'switchbuf' contains

+
+Patch 9.1.1964
+Problem:  Wrong display when using setline() at hit-enter prompt
+         (after 8.2.3204).
+Solution: Only skip scrolling for changed lines in top area if it's
+          scrolled down due to w_topline change. Also add more testing
+          for what 8.2.3204 fixed (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.1965
+Problem:  When exiting at the end of the more prompt (at the hit enter

+
+Patch 9.1.1976
+Problem:  When using listeners, there is no way to run callbacks at

+
+Patch 9.1.1984

+
+Patch 9.1.1989

+
+Patch 9.1.1990
+Problem:  tests: Test_term_gettty() fails when using conpty on Windows,
+          CI uses winpty, so this test passes.
+Solution: Skip the test Test_term_gettty(). Since conpty communicates
+          via anonymous pipes, there is no name that can be obtained
+          with term_gettty() (Muraoka Taro)
+

+Solution: Change type casts
+
+Patch 9.1.1994
+Problem:  More deterministic synchronisation can be established between
+          processes running test cases and collecting visual effects to
+          a screendump file for future verification by anticipating
+          the availability of known parts of such a file and asserting
+          the location of the cursor.
+Solution: Provide a convenience test function that waits a specified
+          time for cursor positioning (Aliaksei Budavei).
+
+Patch 9.1.1995
+Problem:  Data races between test buffers are currently addressed by
+          relying on arbitrary execution delays or blissfully dismissed.
+Solution: Prefer more deterministic synchronisation between test buffers
+          for test cases that generate screendump files with expected
+          results (Aliaksei Budavei).
+
+Patch 9.1.1996
+Problem:  tests: test_cmdline.vim leaves swapfiles behind
+Solution: Close open buffers using :bw! instead of :close!

+
+Patch 9.1.1998
+Problem:  Not enough tests for :setlocal omnifunc (after 9.1.1991).
+Solution: Move the last :new after :setlocal. Also test with 'complete'
+          (zeertzjq).
+
+Patch 9.1.1999
+Problem:  clipboard provider does not respect 'clipboard' option
+          (Satoru Kitaguchi, after v9.1.1972)
+Solution: Make clipboard provider register respect "unnamed/unnamedplus"
+          from the 'clipboard' option value.
+
+Patch 9.1.2000
+Problem:  Vim9: class and object member names are stored as char_u *
+          pointer requiring repeated strlen() calls and making it harder
+          to use length-aware string operations consistently.
+Solution: Store ocm_name as a string_T instead of char_u * (John Marriott).
+
+Patch 9.1.2001
+Problem:  After :botright copen and closing the quikfix window, the
+          cursor ends up in the wrong window. The problem is fr_child
+          always points to the first (leftmost for FR_ROW, topmost for
+          FR_COL) child frame. When do :vsplit, the new window is
+          created on the left, and frame_insert() updates the parent's
+          fr_child to point to this new left window.
+Solution: Create a snapshot before open the quickfix window and restore
+          it when close it (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.2002
+Problem:  Vim9: heap-use-after-free when when accessing protect class
+          member (Foxe Chen)
+Solution: Set cl->class_type_list and return directly, add tests for

+          (Yegappan Lakshmanan).
+
+Patch 9.1.2003
+Problem:  tests: Test_glob_symlinks may fail on Windows with UCRT
+          runtime

+Patch 9.1.2004
+Problem:  MS-Windows: If a directory with a single character name is
+          included in the PATH environment variable without a trailing
+          path separator, executable() will not be able to find the
+          executable file under it.
+Solution: The second argument of the after_pathsep() function is now
+          passed the next pointer where a path separator may exist
+          (Muraoka Taro).
+
+Patch 9.1.2005
+Problem:  MS-Windows: Missing fullscreen support for GUI version
+Solution: Add "s" flag to guioptions (Mao-Yining)
+
+Patch 9.1.2006
+Problem:  ANSI escape colors are not displayed correctly in
+          non-termguicolors in vim (cli) on Windows. The red and blue
+          channels seem to be swapped.
+Cause:    When converting VTerm ANSI index colors to cterm colors in
+          terminal.c, the Windows case equivalent to NR-16 (:help
+          cterm-colors) is ignored.
+Solution: Created and used a table to convert ANSI indexed colors to
+          cterm's NR-16 representation (Windows only). This table
+          corresponds to the inverse conversion of cterm_ansi_idx in
+          term.c. The values in both tables are exactly the same, but
+          the meanings are opposite, so they are separate tables
+          (Muraoka Taro).
+
+Patch 9.1.2007
+Problem:    bpftrace files are not recognized from the hashbang line.
+Solution:   Add a hashbang check (Stanislaw Gruszka).

+
+Patch 9.1.2010

+
+Patch 9.1.2013
+Problem:  tests: When opening a conpty terminal, if process startup

+          Test_terminal_shell_option in test_terminal3.vim failed in
+          conpty.
+Solution: Make conpty fail with an error messages in the same way as winpty
+          (Muraoka Taro).
+
+Patch 9.1.2014
+Problem:  clipboard: clipboard register corrupted with clipboard
+          provider (Satoru Kitaguchi and mikoto2000 after v9.1.1972)

+
+Patch 9.1.2015
+Problem:  blob2string() stopped after an empty line
+Solution: Specifically check for empty content (Foxe Chen).
+

+Problem:  At "if(0) do if(0); while(0); else", else should be aligned
+          with outer if, but is aligned with inner if.
+Solution: In function find_match, ignore "if" and "else" inside a

+Solution: Regenerate the ops.pro proto file (Tao).
+
+Patch 9.1.2019
+Problem:  When virtualedit is set to all, the cursor is supposed to be
+          permitted to reside anywhere, including on the virtual space
+          beyond the end of the buffer's text. Switching modes triggered
+          a routine that "fixed" a cursor that was past the end of the
+          line by shifting it back to the last actual character in the
+          line and compensating with a virtual column offset. While
+          visually identical, this re-encoding changed the underlying
+          byte index, causing position-reporting functions to return
+          inconsistent values after a mode change.
+Solution: Skip this coordinate adjustment when virtual editing is fully
+          enabled. By treating the line terminator as a valid, stable
+          position, the cursor’s internal representation remains

+          check this functionality (McAuley Penney).

+Problem:  Compilation issues on Windows when VIM
+          is compiled with OLE enabled, as "if_ole.cpp" cannot compile
+          due to the keyword conflict (after v9.1.2012).
+Solution: Rename the member variable of `exarg` from `class` to `ea_class`.
+          (Wei Tang)
+
+Patch 9.1.2023
+Problem:  A BufAdd autocommand may cause alist_add() to use freed
+          memory, this is caused by the w_locked variable unset too

+Problem:  tests: Test_terminal_cwd in test_terminal.vim fails flaky
+          in the Windows ConPTY terminal.
+Solution: In ConPTY, the timeout is extended to 1msec when reading a
+          channel associated with a job that is about to finish.  This
+          allows Vim to read the last output of a process in a pseudo

+Problem:  tests: Test_cd_completion() may fail depending on the contents
+          of the root directory of the current drive on Windows.
+          readdir() may return a directory that cannot "cd" to, causing
+          this test to fail. An example of such a directory is
+          "System Volume Information" which only admin can "cd" to.
+Solution: When determining the directory to use for testing, use the
+          directory that we actually "cd" to successfully.
+          In addition, directories with '$' in their names are also
+          excluded, as they are considered environment variables during
+          completion and do not work as expected (Muraoka Taro).
+
+Patch 9.1.2051
+Problem:  Test_cd_completion test fails in Appveyor. In Appveyor, a path
+          containing spaces was selected as the test target. But the

+
+Patch 9.1.2058
+Problem:  b_locked_split is not checked for :sbuffer, which allows
+          autocommands to leave windows open to freed buffers.
+Solution: In do_buffer_ext, check just before possibly splitting, after

+Problem:  When building GvimExt with MinGW, some DLLs are still linked
+          even if STATIC_STDCPLUS=yes is set.
+Solution: Following the Vim core, make some libraries explicitly

+
+Patch 9.1.2069
+Problem:  when shortmess doesn't have 'S', backward search wrap doesn't
+          show the "W" before count. forward search works fine but
+          backward fails because the position check logic is backwards -
+          it checks if cursor < pos instead of using the existing
+          wrapped flag.
+Solution: Use sia->sa_wrapped flag that searchit() already sets
+          correctly (glepnir).
+
+Patch 9.1.2070

+
+Patch 9.1.2091
+Problem:  Ruby headers define HAVE_FSYNC, which leaks into Vim sources
+          on Windows and changes conditional compilation of buf_T. This
+          causes struct layout mismatches in if_ruby.c and results in a

+
+Patch 9.1.2119
+Problem:  tests: Test_language_cmd fails on OpenBSD because the test
+          uses an invalid locale name and expects the command to produce
+          an error. OpenBSD accepts (almost) any locale name as valid by
+          design, so the :lang command succeeds and the test fails.
+Solution: Slightly update the "bad" locale name to make it something
+          that OpenBSD considers invalid by adding a dot (but not ending
+          with ".UTF-8"). Maintain the original two underscores in the
