+Problem:  When garbage collection runs, the list of recorded buffer
+	  changes may be incorrectly freed (Sainnhe Park). 
+Solution: In garbage_collect(), iterate through all buffers and call
+          set_ref_in_list() for b_recorded_changes to ensure the list
+          and its contents are marked as reachable (Paul Ollis).
