+Example setup~
+A typical configuration for automatic completion with a popup menu: >
+	set autocomplete
+	set complete=.^5,w^5,b^5,u^5
+	set completeopt=popup
+
+	inoremap <silent><expr> <Tab>   pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<Tab>"
+	inoremap <silent><expr> <S-Tab> pumvisible() ? "\<C-p>" : "\<S-Tab>"
+<
+This enables automatic completion with suggestions from the current buffer,
+other windows, and listed buffers, displayed in a popup menu.  Each source is
+limited to 5 candidates.  <Tab> and <S-Tab> move through the items when the
+menu is visible.  Optionally, add "preinsert" to 'completeopt' to insert the
+longest common prefix automatically.  You can also add other completion
+sources to 'complete' as needed.
+
+See also 'autocomplete', 'autocompletedelay' and 'autocompletetimeout'.
+
+For command-line autocompletion, see |cmdline-autocompletion|.
