 Each may be followed (several times) by '+' or '-' and an optional number.
 This number is added or subtracted from the preceding line number.  If the
 number is omitted, 1 is used.  If there is nothing before the '+' or '-' then
 the current line is used.

+						*:range-closed-fold*
+When a line number after the comma is in a closed fold it is adjusted to the
+last line of the fold, thus the whole fold is included.
+
+When a number is added this is done after the adjustment to the last line of
+the fold.  This means these lines are additionally included in the range.  For
+example: >
+   :3,4+2print
+On this text:
+	1 one ~
+	2 two ~
+	3 three ~
+	4 four FOLDED ~
+	5 five FOLDED ~
+	6 six ~
+	7 seven ~
+	8 eight ~
+Where lines four and five are a closed fold, ends up printing lines 3 to 7.
+The 7 comes from the "4" in the range, which is adjusted to the end of the
+closed fold, which is 5, and then the offset 2 is added.

+An example for subtracting (which isn't very useful): >

+	8 eight ~
+Where lines three to six are a closed fold, ends up printing lines 2 to 6.
+The 6 comes from the "4" in the range, which is adjusted to the end of the
+closed fold, which is 6, and then 1 is subtracted, then this is still in the
+closed fold and the last line of that fold is used, which is 6.

+							*:range-pattern*
 The "/" and "?" after {pattern} are required to separate the pattern from
 anything that follows.
