+Terminal Colors						*win32-term-colors*
+
+The Win32 console supports 16 colors by default |dos-colors|.  From Windows 10
+version 1703 (Creators Update) onwards, the console supports 256 colors and
+true color (24-bit) when 'termguicolors' is set and Vim is built with support
+for Virtual Terminal Processing (VTP) |+vtp|.
+
+Virtual Terminal Processing is automatically enabled if either the
+'termguicolors' option is set or the 't_Co' option is set to 256.  This
+enables ANSI escape sequences for colors, improves rendering of multi-byte
+characters and enables other terminal features in the Windows console.
+
+The actual color rendering depends on whether your terminal supports VTP (such
+as Windows Terminal or the modern Windows 10/11 console).
