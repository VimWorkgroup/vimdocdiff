+END OF LINE AND END OF FILE				*eol-and-eof*
+
+Vim has several options to control the file format:
+	'fileformat'	the <EOL> style: Unix, DOS, Mac
+	'endofline'	whether the last line ends with a <EOL>
+	'endooffile'	whether the file ends with a CTRL-Z
+	'fixendofline'	whether to fix eol and eof
+
+The first three values are normally detected automatically when reading the
+file and are used when writing the text to a file.  While editing the buffer
+it looks like every line has a line ending and the CTRL-Z isn't there (an
+exception is when 'binary' is set, it works differently then).
+
+The 'fixendofline' option can be used to choose what to write.  You can also
+change the option values to write the file differently than how it was read.
+
+Here are some examples how to use them.
+
+If you want files in Unix format (every line NL terminated): >
+	setl ff=unix fixeol
+You should probably do this on any Unix-like system.  Also modern MS-Windows
+systems tend to work well with this.  It is recommended to always use this
+format for Vim scripts.
+
+If you want to use an old MS-DOS file in a modern environment, fixing line
+endings and dropping CTRL-Z, but keeping the <CR><NL> style <EOL>: >
+	setl ff=dos fixeol
+This is useful for many MS-Windows programs, they regularly expect the
+<CR><NL> line endings.
+
+If you want to drop the final <EOL> and add a final CTRL-Z (e.g. for an old
+system like CP/M): >
+	setl ff=dos nofixeol noeol eof
+
+If you want to preserve the fileformat exactly as-is, including any final
+<EOL> and final CTRL-Z: >
+	setl nofixeol
