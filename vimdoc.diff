 For any non-trivial change, please always create a pull request on github,
 since this triggers the test suite.
 
+A PR should ideally contain a single commit for a single logical change.
+However, you can include several commits if you want to group multiple
+logical, atomic changes in one PR.  This can also make longer PRs easier to
+review.  Be sure to describe the reasoning for your changes in each commit
+message, as this greatly helps with the review process.  In cases where each
+commit handles different logical changes, they will also be applied as
+separate patches in Vimâ€™s repository.
