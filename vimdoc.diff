+==============================================================================
+15. Clipboard providers					*clipboard-providers*
+
+When Vim is compiled with the |+clipboard_provider| feature, which requires
+the |+eval| feature, creating custom clipboards is possible.  These providers
+handle the "+" and "*" registers.  Note that on non-Unix or non-VMS systems,
+only the "*" register will be available for use.
+
+To add a provider, add a new entry to the |v:clipproviders| dictionary, in the
+format of: >
+	let v:clipproviders["name"] = {
+            \   "available": function("Available"),
+            \   "paste": {
+            \       '+': function("Paste"), " For the + register
+            \       '*': function("Paste"), " For the * register
+            \   },
+            \   "copy": {
+            \       '+': function("Copy"), " Same thing as above
+            \       '*': function("Copy"),
+            \   },
+            \ }
+
+The key is the provider name, which should be used in 'clipmethod', for
+example in the following example, you would add "name" to 'clipmethod' in
+order to use it. >
+	set clipmethod=name,wayland,x11,gui
+
+Each callback can either be a name of a function in a string, a |Funcref|, or
+a |lambda| expression.
+
+Note that these dictionary entries are optional, for example, if you don't
+care about the "copy" functions, then you can simply exclude them.  When Vim
+yanks/copies something, then simply nothing will be done.
+
+						*clipboard-provider-available*
+The "available" callback should return a string, which should contain which
+clipboard registers are available.  For example, if the "+" register is only
+available, then the function would return "+", or if both "+" and "*" are
+available, then return "+*".
+
+						*clipboard-provider-paste*
+The "paste" callback takes a first argument which is the register being put
+(string), and a second argument which is the type of access (string).  It
+should return either a tuple/list or string.  If a tuple/list is returned, it
+should have two elements:
+	- The register type conforming to |setreg()|.
+	- A list of strings
+If the register type is an empty string, then the type is automatically
+chosen, see |setreg()|.  If a string is returned, then it can either be "clear"
+or "previous".  "clear" makes Vim clear the register, and "previous" makes Vim
+use the previous register contents (or current depending on how you view it).
+
+The second argument, the access type, can either be "explicit" or "implicit".
+"explicit" means that the user is directly accessing the clipboard, such as
+putting text, or calling |getreg()|;  "implicit" means that the clipboard is
+being accessed indirectly, such when |:registers| is called, or when an
+unrelated operation causes Vim to access the clipboard.
+
+This is useful since some operations in Vim implicity access the clipboard
+indirectly.  For example, if when you want to create a provider for the OSC52
+command (accessing the clipboard via an escape code).  Many terminals show a
+confirmation if you want Vim to access the clipboard.  This can be very
+annoying with the terminal asking for permission everytime you do something
+that accesses the clipboard behind the scenes.  A good way to handle implicit
+access is to return "previous", which leaves the register contents unchanged.
+
+						*clipboard-provider-copy*
+The "copy" callback returns nothing, and takes the given arguments in order:
+	- The register being operated on
+	- The register type, conforming to |getregtype()|
+	- A list of strings to copy
+
+The provider can do whatever it wants with the given information.  This
+function is called on every request to change the clipboard register(s).
+
+						*clipboard-provider-textlock*
+In both the "paste" and "copy" callbacks, it is not allowed to change the
+buffer text, see |textlock|.
+
+						*clipboard-provider-example*
+Here is an example script that uses the clipboard provider feature through the
+OSC52 command: >vim
+
+	func Available()
+	  return "+"
+	endfunc
+	
+	func Paste(reg, type)
+	  " If implicit access, don't do anything
+	  if a:type == "implicit"
+	    return "previous"
+	  endif
+	
+	  augroup OSC
+	    autocmd!
+	    autocmd TermResponseAll osc ++once call feedkeys("\<F30>", '!')
+	  augroup END
+	
+	  " Send command
+	  call echoraw("\<Esc>]52;c;?\<Esc>\\")
+	
+	  " Wait until autocmd is triggered
+	  while getchar(-1) != "\<F30>"
+	  endwhile
+	
+	  autocmd! OSC
+	
+	  " Extract the base64 stuff
+	  let l:stuff = matchstr(v:termosc, '52;c;\zs[A-Za-z0-9+/=]\+')
+	
+	  return ("", blob2str(base64_decode(l:stuff)))
+	endfunc
+
+	func Copy(reg, type, lines)
+	  call echoraw("\<Esc>]52;c;" ..
+	    \ base64_encode(str2blob(a:lines)) .. "\<Esc>\\")
+	endfunc
+	let v:clipproviders["myosc"] = {
+	    \   "available": function("Available"),
+	    \   "paste": {
+	    \     '+': function("Paste"),
+	    \   },
+	    \   "copy": {
+	    \     '+': function("Copy"),
+	    \   },
