 		The result is a Number, which is the screen column of the file
-		position given with {expr}.  That is, the last screen position

 		position, the returned Number will be the column at the end of
 		the <Tab>.  For example, for a <Tab> in column 1, with 'ts'
 		set to 8, it returns 8. |conceal| is ignored.
