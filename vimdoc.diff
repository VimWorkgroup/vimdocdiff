+FREEBASIC						*ft-freebasic-plugin*
+
+This plugin aims to treat the four FreeBASIC dialects, "fb", "qb", "fblite"
+and "deprecated", as distinct languages.
+
+The dialect will be set to the first name found in g:freebasic_forcelang, any
+#lang directive or $lang metacommand in the file being edited, or finally
+g:freebasic_lang.  These global variables conceptually map to the fbc options
+-forcelang and -lang.  If no dialect is explicitly specified "fb" will be
+used.
+
+For example, to set the dialect to a default of "fblite" but still allow for
+any #lang directive overrides, use the following command: >
+
+     let g:freebasic_lang = "fblite"
