 A known side effect is that in Insert mode the raw escape sequence is inserted
 after the CTRL-V key.  This can be used to check whether modifyOtherKeys is

 When the 'esckeys' option is off, then modifyOtherKeys will be disabled in
 Insert mode to avoid every key with a modifier causing Insert mode to end.
