+When 'jumpoptions' option includes "stack", the jumplist behaves like the tag
+stack.  When jumping to a new location from the middle of the jumplist, the
+locations after the current position will be discarded. With this option set
+you can move through a tree of jump locations. When going back up a branch and
+then down another branch, CTRL-O still takes you further up the tree.

+Given a jumplist like the following in which CTRL-O has been used to move back
+three times to location X: >
