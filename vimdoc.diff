 backslash.  To include a backslash you have to use two.  Effectively this
 means that the number of backslashes in an option value is halved (rounded
 down).
+In options 'path', 'cdpath', and 'tags', spaces have to be preceded with three
+backslashes instead for compatibility with version 3.0 where the options can
+be separated by either commas or spaces.
+Comma-separated options like 'backupdir' and 'tags' will also require commas
+to be escaped with two backslashes, whereas this is not needed for
+non-comma-separated ones like 'makeprg'.
+When setting options using |:let| and |literal-string|, you need to use one
+fewer layer of backslash.
