-		Move the window {nr} to a new split of the window {target}.
-		This is similar to moving to {target}, creating a new window
-		using |:split| but having the same contents as window {nr}, and
-		then closing {nr}.
+		Temporarily switch to window {target}, then move window {nr}
+		to a new split adjacent to {target}.
+		Unlike commands such as |:split|, no new windows are created
+		(the |window-ID| of window {nr} is unchanged after the move).
 
 		Both {nr} and {target} can be window numbers or |window-ID|s.
 		Both must be in the current tab page.
