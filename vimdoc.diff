+		{expr2} must be a |string| or |Funcref|.
+
+		If {expr2} is a |string|, inside {expr2} |v:val| has the value
+		of the current item.  For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key
+		of the current item and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of
+		the current item.  For a |Blob| |v:key| has the index of the
+		current byte. For a |String| |v:key| has the index of the
+		current character.
+		Examples: >
+			call foreach(mylist, 'used[v:val] = true')
+<		This records the items that are in the {expr1} list.
+
+		Note that {expr2} is the result of expression and is then used
+		as a command.  Often it is good to use a |literal-string| to
+		avoid having to double backslashes.
+
+		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it must take two arguments:
+			1. the key or the index of the current item.
+			2. the value of the current item.
+		With a legacy script lambda you don't get an error if it only
+		accepts one argument, but with a Vim9 lambda you get "E1106:
+		One argument too many", the number of arguments must match.
+		If the function returns a value, it is ignored.
+
+		Returns {expr1} in all cases.
+		When an error is encountered while executing {expr2} no
+		further items in {expr1} are processed.
+		When {expr2} is a Funcref errors inside a function are ignored,
+		unless it was defined with the "abort" flag.
